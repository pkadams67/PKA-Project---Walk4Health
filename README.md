# Walk4Health — “Keep Moving!”

This simple fitness app helps health-conscious iPhone users track their walking time and distance. With permission, it ties into Apple's easy-to-read Health dashboard, providing awareness and motivation by displaying fitness progress over time.

Walk4Health uses Core Location and HealthKit to help folks track the time and distance they walk. Written completely in Swift, this app demonstrates just a few of my iOS developer skills. Enjoy!
